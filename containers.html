   <h3>Concert Band</h3>
   <p>The Luther College Concert Band is the oldest ensemble at Luther, dating back to the early days of Luther. It's also one of the very first touring collegiate ensembles in the country, led by Carlo Sperati.</p>

   <h3>Chamber Orchestra</h3>
   <p>The Chamber Orchestra is a smaller version of the Symphony Orchestra. We play much older music, written by Haydn or Mozart, for example. This is because orchestras in their day were smaller than modern orchestras.</p>

   <h3>Other Ensembles</h3>
   <p>Though not official ensembles, I do participate in several groups around campus. Some are student-led and some work with faculty.</p>
   <h4>Pep Band</h4>
   <p>Probably one of my most favorite ensembles is the LC Pep Band. The pep band is an entirely student-led ensemble that performs at sporting events and other functions, playing popular tunes old and new.</p>
   <h4>Fortress Brass</h4>
   <p>Fortress Brass is the smallest ensemble I play in, at only 5 members. It's a traditional brass quintet that's been around for several years, with members rotating in and out as needed. This is my first year in the quintet, which is exciting because we are going along with the Concert Band tour in the spring to become the very first touring chamber group at Luther.</p>
