    <p>My name is Shafer Stromwall, and I am a senior music major at Luther College. I enjoy playing trumpet and writing music, but I also enjoy playing all<br>
    sorts of games with friends. I think my most important role at Luther is my position as part of the the Pep Band leadership, where I help maintain<br>
    our music library. Next year's plan are still being planned, but I hope to start writing my own music for high school marching bands and pep bands.</p>
